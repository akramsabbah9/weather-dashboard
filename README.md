# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This application utilizes the OpenWeather API to list the weather data for a given city. It displays a city's current weather conditions, as well as its temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. In addition, a five-day forecast of the weather conditions for that city is shown below the current day's conditions.

The end user may use the "Search for a City" searchbar to enter the name of a desired location they wish to view the weather for. Previous searches are saved in a list on the left side of the page. Users may click on the cities listed in the search history to bring up their current weather data.

The user's most recently searched city and their search history are saved in localStorage, so the page can be refreshed without loss of data.

## Usage

Visit the webpage and type the name of a city in the searchbar, then press enter or click the magnifying glass icon. The weather data for that city will be displayed on the main part of the page, as well as weather conditions for the next five days. Underneath the searchbar is a list of the last ten cities that were searched. Click on one to view its weather conditions again.
